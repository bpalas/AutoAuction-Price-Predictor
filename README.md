# Karcal Auto Auction Price Predictor ðŸš—

This project uses **machine learning** to predict car prices on the Karcal auction website. We've built a robust model by scraping and analyzing historical auction data ðŸ“Š to provide accurate price forecasts.

A key focus of this project is **model explainability**. We use techniques to understand *why* the model makes its predictions, identifying which featuresâ€”like mileage, year, and makeâ€”have the biggest impact on a car's final sale price ðŸ“ˆ.

## Features âœ¨

- **Web Scraping:** Scripts to automatically collect data from the Karcal website.
- **Predictive Model:** A machine learning model that forecasts auction prices with high accuracy.
- **Explainable AI (XAI):** Tools to interpret model decisions and identify key market drivers.
- **Data Visualization:** Insights into auction trends and variable importance.

This project is great for anyone looking to understand the dynamics of the used car auction market or build a predictive model from scratch! ðŸš€
